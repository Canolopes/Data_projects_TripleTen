# Integrated Project 1

This project was the first project which integrated all the previous chapters into one task. In this project, my purpose was to incorporate EDA, SDA, and visualizations on video game data to come up with conclusions about how a game becomes succeeds and analyze differences in three regions (NA, EU, JP).

## Data Description

—JP_sales (sales in Japan in USD million) 

—Other_sales (sales in other countries in USD million) 

—Critic_Score (maximum of 100) 

—User_Score (maximum of 10) 

—Rating (ESRB)

## The Process

This project definitely had the lengthiest EDA of any dataset in the entire TripleTen data science program. There were numerous conclusions to be made from the video game data as a whole and in different regions. We were able to conclude that marketing efforts should focus on the biggest market-share regions of NA and EU. Additionally, JP had much different behaviors with regards to the data, such as the higher prevalence of handhelds, and the diminished popularity of shooting games compared to NA and EU (two regions which tend to behave similarly for the most part). We also noticed that some consoles were carried incredibly by outliers, such as the Wii. Our statistical analysis included a two sample test between the sports and action genres. I used matplotlib, seaborn, and the stats libraries to create the visualizations and conduct the tests necessary to come to my conclusions.

There is much more analysis on this dataset that can be observed by opening the attached Jupyter Notebook.
