# TripleTen Data Projects
Data projects I worked on for TripleTen Data Science program

| Project number | Title | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | EDA Project 1 | This was an exploratory data analysis project where the task was to look into Instacart data and give insights and visualizations about customer habits. |
| 2 | Integrated Project 1 | This project looked into video game sales data and was filled with exploratory and statistical data analysis with several visualizations. |
| 3 | Machine Learning | The first machine learning project of the program, the task was to look into phone service data and create a model that could accurately recommend the correct plan to customers. |
| 4 | Supervised Learning | Diving deeper into machine learning, this task was to look into bank customer data and help predict if a customer would leave. |
| 5 | Numerical Methods | Exploring more advanced numerical methods, this project was the first to implement gradient boosting to help develop an app with the ability to quickly and accurately assess vehicle prices on the market.  |
| 6 | Time Series Analysis | This project focused on time series analysis, using methods such as random forest and gradient boosting to create short-term forecasting for a taxi company. |
| 7 | Computer Vision | The task here was to create a model to help identify age from faces and reduce the mean absolute error. This task was the first to involve GPU testing to provide our final results. |
| 8 | Final Project | This was the final summation of all lessons turned into one. The task was to create a model to predict customer churn and implemented various lessons in data scaling, one-hot encoding, model training with gradient boosting and KNN, EDA, and data visualization. |
